Exploration of titanic data using Spark and Smile to divide data to train and test data 
Explore Train and test data , omit null data from both train and test data, get some summary statistics about train and test data
implement a machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) to get some predictions and calculate the accuracy (this is for testing only not accurate algorithm implemenation)
